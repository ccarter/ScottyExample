* Pre-reqs
- Recent version of GHC. I'm using 7.8.2
- Recent version of Cabal. I'm using 1.20.0.2
* Setup
- Cabal update
- Make the directory where our project will live.
  - make sub-directory called src in this dir.
- Make a file called Main.hs with the main function in it inside src. This is only temporary to get our project
  compiling/running.
  - module Main where

    main :: IO ()
    main = putStrLn "wee"

- Cd into the project directory
- run: cabal init
  - Take defaults except for the Library | Executable question. Pick Executable.
  - Modify your .cabal file to include the following in the Executable section
    - hs-source-dirs: src
- CRITICAL!: run (cabal sandbox init) This creates a sandbox that I can go more into if needed.
- Your application should now build (cabal build) and run (cabal run)
* Scotty
- Add scotty as a dependency in your .cabal
  -   build-depends:       base >=4.7 && <4.8
                         , scotty
- Install scotty and it's dependencies (cabal install --only-dependencies)
